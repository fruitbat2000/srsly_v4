### Otherwise known as first adventures in React JS 2015

#### Stuff you might want to know...

This site is built using React JS, it's isomorphic so all JS is server-side rendered initially for speed and SEO and stuff. Subsequent content changes are handled client-side as per standard SPA-type architecture. JS/JSX is compiled using Webpack, CSS is preprocessed using LESS, automation tasks are handled via Grunt and the whole lot runs on a node Express server.
